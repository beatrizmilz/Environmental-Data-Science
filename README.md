# Environmental Data Science
Welcome!

This repository gathers information about Environmental Data Science, such as events, groups, books, papers, journals, courses, etc.

The idea is to have a place to find information about environmental data science and share it with others.

Feel free to contribute by suggesting contents (e.g., [open an issue](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/Environmental-Data-Science/issues)) or by making a pull request to [add new content in this file](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/Environmental-Data-Science/blob/main/README.Rmd).

This repository was created by [Beatriz Milz](https://beamilz.com/) in March 2021.
